## 1 First part

I don't know how it happened, but it's been going on for more than one day. I went outside because my friend and I had agreed to meet. I was sitting on a swing and saw that there was a portal ahead, which was located on a building to my left and to the right of the end of the building. I decided to try throwing something into it. I threw something and saw that a process had started there. Looking a little to the right, I saw that the continuation of the portal was near me, about 10 steps away from me. I quickly decided that I needed to run into the store before something came out of the portal. I ran and thought, "Why did I do this, why!"

Having rushed into the store, I saw one of the customers. I asked the seller to lock the door, but she was not in a hurry and did not understand why I was so anxious. When she approached the door, something humanoid decided to take her away. I got scared and realized that this was the end, and decided to hide in the refrigerator for beer. It was not transparent so there were chances that it wouldn't find me.

I heard the door open and my refrigerator fell to the floor. Through a crack, I saw legs with blue socks on them. I realized it was Adelina. I quickly got out and decided to ask what had happened outside. But before I could say a word, she said to me: "Katya! Well done for doing so well! When I read about you in the group, I was so happy for you! You are our Blue Archer!!"

I was surprised and asked her what she was talking about. It turned out that I was part of a squad where people kill creatures coming from these portals. These portals are like exits from the abyss, from which monsters emerge if the beginning of the portal into the abyss is disturbed. I had a slightly middle rank and was known as the "Blue Archer" (I don't know how they assign the names).

The second Adelina stopped speaking, I remembered how I was learning to dry cosmic protein with a guy for the first time. Cosmic protein is a protein that replaces terrestrial protein and is simply fished out of space and laid out on special plates that fly through space, thus collecting protein. The protein is removed with the help of a thin thread, which separates it from the plates. The guy kindly gave me most of the protein, as at that moment I was just starting my activities as a "Blue Archer".

After Adelina explained the situation to me, I asked if there are meetings at school for the archers, but she didnâ€™t know. So, I decided to go to school the next day to ask.

When I got home, my mom ran up to me and started asking where I had been and what I was doing. I explained everything to her, but she just started screaming, "Where did you get the idea that you are an archer?! You won't go anywhere tomorrow, it's dangerous outside!", but I wasn't listening to my mom anymore, I was just thinking about how to get to school if mom is against it, because I couldn't stand her constant yelling. At that moment, I remembered that my mom wakes up closer to the end of lunch, which means that in the morning I will be able to go to school and ask everything.

In the morning, as I expected, my mom was asleep, and I went to school. At school, I met my math teacher - who is also my class teacher. I greeted her and decided to find out about the archers and whether they have meetings. The teacher was surprised that I had forgotten everything, as we had discussed this at the first meeting. I asked her to tell me everything again, because it seemed like I had lost my memory...

After a conversation that lasted almost 3 hours, I found out that when it all started, we were gathered on the 1st floor of the school and were told: "you will all go through a selection process into different categories and will help the country deal with this situation! The categories are as follows:

Archers - they will be numbered depending on skills, accuracy, resilience, and various characteristics. They will be numbered by colors. What colors are used and how they are assigned will be explained later.

Inventors - as can be understood from the name, they will be inventing, improving, and building various things.

Hunters - these people will be doing the same work as the "archers", but in close combat. "Hunters" and "archers" must get along with each other because you will need to fight side by side!

Protector - you will be protecting children, the elderly, and the disabled! You will be staying at their homes and helping them with cooking, groceries, taking out the trash, and much more!

The rest will be helping with cooking, cleaning, and other jobs!
